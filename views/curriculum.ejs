        <p>
            At the pre-nursery and nursery level, toddlers are formed into playgroups and are taught to identify shapes, colours, and numbers. 
            They are carefully and gradually introduced to the letters of the alphabet and, by using teaching aids and fun learning, smoothly 
            taught to read and write. They are also taught to understand the world around them, morals, basic hygiene and cleanliness, arts,
             music, and science. They are taught through examples and proper guidance.
        </p>
